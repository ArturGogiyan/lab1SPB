NAME
     ls - list contents of directory

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/ls  [-aAbcCdeEfFghHilLmnopqrRstuvVx1@] [_f_i_l_e]...


     /usr/xpg4/bin/ls  [-aAbcCdeEfFghHilLmnopqrRstuvVx1@]
      [_f_i_l_e]...


     /usr/xpg6/bin/ls  [-aAbcCdeEfFghHilLmnopqrRstuvVx1@]
      [_f_i_l_e]...


DESCRIPTION
     For each _f_i_l_e that is a directory, ls lists the contents  of
     the  directory.  For  each _f_i_l_e that is an ordinary file, ls
     repeats its name and any other  information  requested.  The
     output is sorted alphabetically by default. When no argument
     is given, the current directory (.) is listed. When  several
     arguments   are   given,  the  arguments  are  first  sorted
     appropriately, but file arguments appear before  directories
     and their contents.


     There are three major listing formats.  The  default  format
     for  output  directed  to  a  terminal  is multi-column with
     entries sorted down the columns. The -1 option allows single
     column  output and -m enables stream output format. In order
     to determine output formats for the -C, -x, and -m  options,
     ls  uses  an environment variable, COLUMNS, to determine the
     number of character positions available on one output  line.
     If  this  variable  is  not set, the terminfo(4) database is
     used to determine  the  number  of  columns,  based  on  the
     environment  variable,  TERM.  If this information cannot be
     obtained, 80 columns are assumed.


     The mode printed when the -e, -E, -g, -l, -n, -o, -v, -V, or
     -@  option  is  in effect consists of eleven characters. The
     first character can be one of the following:

     d            The entry is a directory.


     D            The entry is a door.


     l            The entry is a symbolic link.

User Commands                                               ls(1)



     b            The entry is a block special file.


     c            The entry is a character special file.


     p            The entry is a FIFO (or "named  pipe")  special
                  file.


     P            The entry is an event port.


     s            The entry is an AF_UNIX address family socket.


     -            The entry is an ordinary file.



     The next 9 characters are interpreted as three sets of three
     bits  each. The first set refers to the owner's permissions;
     the next to permissions of others in the user-group  of  the
     file; and the last to all others. Within each set, the three
     characters indicate permission to read,  to  write,  and  to
     execute  the  file  as a program, respectively. For a direc-
     tory, execute permission is interpreted to  mean  permission
     to  search the directory for a specified file. The character
     after permissions is an ACL or extended  attributes  indica-
     tor. This character is an @ if extended attributes are asso-
     ciated with the file and the -@ option is in effect.  Other-
     wise,  this character is a plus sign (+) character if a non-
     trivial ACL is associated with the file or a space character
     if not.


     ls -l (the long list) prints its output as follows  for  the
     POSIX locale:

       -rwxrwxrwx+ 1 smith dev   10876  May 16 9:42 part2




     Reading from right to left, you see that the current  direc-
     tory  holds  one file, named part2. Next, the last time that
     file's contents were modified was 9:42 A.M. on May  16.  The
     file  contains 10,876 characters, or bytes. The owner of the
     file, or the user, belongs to the group dev  (perhaps  indi-
     cating ``development''), and his or her login name is smith.
     The number, in this case 1, indicates the number of links to
     file  part2  (see cp(1)). The plus sign indicates that there

     is an ACL associated with the file. If  the  -@  option  has
     been  specified,  the presence of extended attributes super-
     sede the presence of an ACL and the plus  sign  is  replaced
     with  an  'at'  sign (@). Finally, the dash and letters tell
     you that user, group, and others have permissions  to  read,
     write, and execute part2.


     The execute (x) symbol here occupies the third  position  of
     the  three-character  sequence.  A  -  in the third position
     would have indicated a denial of execution permissions.


     The permissions are indicated as follows:

     r            The file is readable.


     w            The file is writable.


     x            The file is executable.


     -            The indicated permission is _n_o_t granted.


     s            The set-user-ID or set-group-ID bit is on,  and
                  the  corresponding  user or group execution bit
                  is also on.


     S            Undefined bit-state (the  set-user-ID  or  set-
                  group-id bit is on and the user or group execu-
                  tion bit is off). For group  permissions,  this
                  applies only to non-regular files.


     t            The 1000 (octal) bit, or sticky bit, is on (see
                  chmod(1)), and execution is on.


     T            The 1000 bit is turned on, and execution is off
                  (undefined bit-state).


  /usr/bin/ls
     l            Mandatory locking occurs during  access  (on  a
                  regular  file,  the  set-group-ID bit is on and
                  the group execution bit is off).

  /usr/xpg4/bin/ls and /usr/xpg6/bin/ls
     L            Mandatory locking occurs during  access  (on  a
                  regular  file,  the  set-group-ID bit is on and
                  the group execution bit is off).



     For user and group permissions, the third position is  some-
     times occupied by a character other than x or -. s or S also
     can occupy this position, referring  to  the  state  of  the
     set-ID  bit,  whether  it  be the user's or the group's. The
     ability to assume the same ID as the user  during  execution
     is,  for  example,  used during login when you begin as root
     but need to assume the identity of the user you login as.


     In the case of the sequence  of  group  permissions,  l  can
     occupy  the  third  position. l refers to mandatory file and
     record locking. This permission describes a  file's  ability
     to  allow other files to lock its reading or writing permis-
     sions during access.


     For others permissions, the third position can  be  occupied
     by  t  or  T. These refer to the state of the sticky bit and
     execution permissions.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

  /usr/bin/ls, /usr/xpg4/bin/ls, and /usr/xpg6/bin/ls
     The following options are supported for all three versions:

     -a           Lists all entries, including those  that  begin
                  with a dot (.), which are normally not listed.


     -A           Lists all entries, including those  that  begin
                  with a dot (.), with the exception of the work-
                  ing directory  (.)  and  the  parent  directory
                  (..).


     -b           Forces printing of non-printable characters  to
                  be in the octal \_d_d_d notation.


     -c           Uses time of last modification  of  the  i-node
                  (file  created, mode changed, and so forth) for
                  sorting (-t) or printing (-l or -n).

User Commands                                               ls(1)



     -C           Multi-column output with  entries  sorted  down
                  the columns. This is the default output format.


     -d           If an argument is a directory, lists  only  its
                  name  (not its contents). Often used with -l to
                  get the status of a directory.


     -e           The same as -l, except  displays  time  to  the
                  second,  and  with  one  format  for  all files
                  regardless of age: _m_m_m _d_d _h_h:_m_m:_s_s _y_y_y_y.


     -E           The same as -l, except  displays  time  to  the
                  nanosecond  and  with  one format for all files
                  regardless       of       age:       _y_y_y_y-_m_m-_d_d
                  _h_h:_m_m:_s_s._n_n_n_n_n_n_n_n_n (ISO 8601:2000 format).

                  In addition, this option  displays  the  offset
                  from  UTC  in  ISO  8601:2000  standard  format
                  (+_h_h_m_m or -_h_h_m_m) or no characters if the offset
                  is  indeterminable.  The  offset  reflects  the
                  appropriate standard  or  alternate  offset  in
                  force  at  the  file's displayed date and time,
                  under the current timezone.


     -f           Forces each argument to  be  interpreted  as  a
                  directory and list the name found in each slot.
                  This option turns off -l, -t, -s, and  -r,  and
                  turns  on  -a.  The order is the order in which
                  entries appear in the directory.


     -g           The same as -l, except that the  owner  is  not
                  printed.


     -h           All sizes are scaled to a human  readable  for-
                  mat,  for  example,  14K,  234M, 2.7G, or 3.0T.
                  Scaling is done  by  repetitively  dividing  by
                  1024.


     -H           If an argument is a symbolic link  that  refer-
                  ences  a  directory,  this option evaluates the
                  file information and file type of the directory
                  that  the link references, rather than those of
                  the link itself. However, the name of the  link
                  is displayed, rather than the referenced direc-
                  tory.

     -i           For each file, prints the i-node number in  the
                  first column of the report.


     -l           Lists in long format, giving mode, ACL  indica-
                  tion,  number  of  links, owner, group, size in
                  bytes, and time of last modification  for  each
                  file  (see  above).  If  the  file is a special
                  file, the size field instead contains the major
                  and  minor  device numbers. If the time of last
                  modification is greater than six months ago, it
                  is  shown  in  the format `month date year' for
                  the  POSIX  locale.  When  the  LC_TIME  locale
                  category is not set to the POSIX locale, a dif-
                  ferent format of the time field  can  be  used.
                  Files  modified  within  six months show `month
                  date time'. If the file is a symbolic link, the
                  filename  is  printed  followed by "->" and the
                  path name of the referenced file.


     -L           If an argument is a symbolic link, this  option
                  evaluates the file information and file type of
                  the file or directory that the link references,
                  rather  than those of the link itself. However,
                  the name of the link is displayed, rather  than
                  the referenced file or directory.


     -m           Streams output format. Files are listed  across
                  the page, separated by commas.


     -n           The same as -l, except that the owner's UID and
                  group's  GID  numbers  are printed, rather than
                  the associated character strings.


     -o           The same as -l, except that the  group  is  not
                  printed.


     -p           Puts a slash (/) after  each  filename  if  the
                  file is a directory.


     -q           Forces printing of non-printable characters  in
                  file names as the character question mark (?).


     -r           Reverses the  order  of  sort  to  get  reverse
                  alphabetic or oldest first as appropriate.

     -R           Recursively lists subdirectories encountered.


     -s           Indicate the total number of file system blocks
                  consumed by each file displayed.


     -t           Sorts by time stamp (latest first)  instead  of
                  by  name.  The default is the last modification
                  time. (See -u and -c.)


     -u           Uses time of last access instead of last modif-
                  ication  for  sorting  (with  the -t option) or
                  printing (with the -l option).


     -v           The same as -l, except that verbose ACL  infor-
                  mation  is  displayed as well as the -l output.
                  ACL information is displayed even if  the  file
                  or directory doesn't have an ACL.


     -V           The same as -l, except that compact ACL  infor-
                  mation is displayed after the -l output.

                  The -V option is only applicable to  file  sys-
                  tems  that  support  NFSv4  ACLs,  such  as the
                  Solaris ZFS file system.

                  The format of the displayed ACL is as follows:

                    _e_n_t_r_y__t_y_p_e : _p_e_r_m_i_s_s_i_o_n_s : _i_n_h_e_r_i_t_a_n_c_e__f_l_a_g_s : _a_c_c_e_s_s__t_y_p_e


                  _e_n_t_r_y__t_y_p_e is displayed as one of  the  follow-
                  ing:

                  user:_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e

     2^31 bytes).

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Viewing File Permissions


     The following example shows how to display detailed informa-
     tion about a file.


       % ls -l file.1
       -rw-r--r--   1 gozer    staff     206663 Mar 14 10:15 file.1







SunOS 5.10          Last change: 10 Feb 2009                   13






User Commands                                               ls(1)



     The permissions string above (-rw-r--r--) describes that the
     file  owner has read and write permissions, the owning group
     has read permisisons, and others have read permissions.



     The following example shows how to display detailed informa-
     tion about a directory.


       % ls -ld test.dir
       drwxr-xr-x   2 gozer    staff          2 Mar 14 10:17 test.dir




     The permissions string above (drwxr-xr-x) describes that the
     directory  owner  has  read, write, and execute permissions,
     the owning group has read and execute permissions, and  oth-
     ers have read and execute permissions.



     Another example of listing file permissions is as follows:


       % ls -l file.2
       -rw-rwl---   1 gozer    staff     206663 Mar 14 10:47 file.2




     The permissions string above (-rw-rwl---) describes that the
     file  owner has read and write permissions, the owning group
     has read and write permissions, and the file can  be  locked
     during access.


     Example 2 Displaying ACL Information  on  Files  and  Direc-
     tories


     The following example  shows  how  to  display  verbose  ACL
     information on a ZFS file.


       % ls -v file.1
       -rw-r--r--   1 marks    staff     206663 Mar 14 10:15 file.1
            0:owner@:execute:deny
            1:owner@:read_data/write_data/append_data/write_xattr/write_attributes
                 /write_acl/write_owner:allow
            2:group@:write_data/append_data/execute:deny

User Commands                                               ls(1)



            3:group@:read_data:allow
            4:everyone@:write_data/append_data/write_xattr/execute/write_attributes
                 /write_acl/write_owner:deny
            5:everyone@:read_data/read_xattr/read_attributes/read_acl/synchronize
                 :allow




     The following example  shows  how  to  display  compact  ACL
     information on a ZFS  directory.


       % ls -dV test.dir
       drwxr-xr-x   2 marks    staff          2 Mar 14 10:17 test.dir
                   owner@:--------------:------:deny
                   owner@:rwxp---A-W-Co-:------:allow
                   group@:-w-p----------:------:deny
                   group@:r-x-----------:------:allow
                   everyone@:-w-p---A-W-Co-:------:deny
                   everyone@:r-x---a-R-c--s:------:allow




     The following example illustrates the ls  -v  behavior  when
     listing ACL  information on a UFS file.


       $ ls -v file.3
       -rw-r--r--   1 root     root        2703 Mar 14 10:59 file.3
            0:user::rw-
            1:group::r--               #effective:r--
            2:mask:r--
            3:other:r--



     Example 3 Printing the Names of All Files


     This command prints the names of all files  in  the  current
     directory,  including those that begin with a dot (.), which
     normally do not print:


       example% ls -a



     Example 4 Providing File Information




SunOS 5.10          Last change: 10 Feb 2009                   15






User Commands                                               ls(1)



     Another example of a command line is:


       example% ls -aisn




     This command provides information on  all  files,  including
     those  that  begin  with  a dot (a), the i-number-the memory
     address of the i-node associated with  the  file-printed  in
     the left-hand column (i); the size (in blocks) of the files,
     printed in the column to the right  of  the  i-numbers  (s);
     finally,  the  report is displayed in the numeric version of
     the long list, printing the UID (instead of user  name)  and
     GID  (instead  of  group  name)  numbers associated with the
     files.



     When the sizes of the files in a  directory  are  listed,  a
     total   count  of  blocks,  including  indirect  blocks,  is
     printed.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment
     variables  that  affect  the  execution of ls: LANG, LC_ALL,
     LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_TIME, LC_MESSAGES, NLSPATH, and TZ.

     COLUMNS             Determines the user's  preferred  column
                         position   width  for  writing  multiple
                         text-column  output.  If  this  variable
                         contains a string representing a decimal
                         integer, the ls utility  calculates  how
                         many  path  name  text  columns to write
                         (see -C) based on the width provided. If
                         COLUMNS  is not set or is invalid, 80 is
                         used. The column width chosen  to  write
                         the  names  of files in any given direc-
                         tory is constant. File names are not  be
                         truncated   to  fit  into  the  multiple
                         text-column output.


EXIT STATUS
     0            All information was written successfully.


     >0           An error occurred.

NOTES
     Unprintable characters in file names can confuse the  colum-
     nar output options.


     The total block count is incorrect if there are  hard  links
     among the files.


     The sort order of ls output is affected by  the  locale  and
     can  be  overridden  by the LC_COLLATE environment variable.
     For example, if LC_COLLATE equals C, dot files appear first,
     followed  by  names  beginning with upper-case letters, then
     followed by names beginning with lower-case letters. But  if
     LC_COLLATE equals en_US.ISO8859-1, then leading dots as well
     as case are ignored in determining the sort order.
